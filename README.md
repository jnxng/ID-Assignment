# Your Mother's Covid-19 Stats

The purpose of the site is to show daily COVID case numbers in the country you are in. It works by taking your country of residence and draws data from a trusted source to display the information on the number of Covid Cases, Deaths by Covid and "Recovery".

# Design Process

We started by researching on Covid-19 Websites that already exist and taking some inspiration from them like the format of the website and method of displaying said information.
One of us worked on the graph while the other worked on the design of the website.
The wireframe can be accessed in its specific file.

# Features

-Existing Features-
The website enables the user to see the statistics regarding Covid-19 Cases worldwide. The statistics shown will automatically be shown according to their own country based on their IP Address. Alternatively, they can choose to select other countries as well to see the respective countries' statistics for Covid-19. The statistics include the total cases of Covid-19, deaths by Covid-19 and the number of recoveries. The statistics are shown in the form of a graph with curves for the different types of data, each having its own colour and a legend for the user to know which curve represents which data.

-Features left to implement-
-The about page is left to be implemented based on what users would like to see in it.
-The recovery numbers were abit bugged and we did not really know how to rectify the issue here as it used the same code for the other data yet it was the only one that didn't work according to how we wanted it to.

# Technologies Used

-Covid-19 API-
It was the API used to assist us in getting the information from different countries to display the data in each country which is the main purpose of the website.

-Adobe Xd-
To create the wireframe
